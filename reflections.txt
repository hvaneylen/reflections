git is code oriented and a software projects implies many files
google docs as its name says is document oriented and so far interested in changes of one document

view history of files 
git log list all the commits with their comment - a comment indicates what is the reason of the commit
git diff can be use to see the differences between repository version2 and version3 listing all add and deletion for each file

git checkout <commitId>  replace all the files in the version given by the commitId - so you can experiment change and always get back to a version that worked.

i will use git with bitbucket to save my generation project and access it from different host i use to continue working on
