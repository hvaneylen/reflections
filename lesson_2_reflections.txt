initialize a repository (git init)  creates the hidden directory .git for git to manage version control for this directory (becoming a repository)
and that's all - I have to explicitly commit the files I wanted git to manage - good thing because all files aren't to be 
managed (i.e generated files from model for example)

how is the staging area different from working directory and repository
it's a tracker of files to commit not a real directory

git add <filename>  add the file to the staging area
git reset <filename> remove the file from the staging area
